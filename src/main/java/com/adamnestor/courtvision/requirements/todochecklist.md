# CourtVision Implementation Checklist

## Core Methods to Implement

### 1. WarmingStrategyService Methods
- [ ] `implementPriorityWarming()`
  - Warm today's games
  - Warm active players' stats
  - Warm common hit rates
  - Track progress
  - Error handling and logging

- [ ] `implementOptionalWarming()`
  - Warm historical data (last 7 days)
  - Warm extended player stats
  - Track progress
  - Error handling and logging

- [ ] `trackWarmingProgress()`
  - Store progress data in Redis
  - Include timestamp and status
  - 24-hour TTL
  - Error handling and logging

### 2. DailyRefreshService Methods
- [ ] `updatePlayerStats()`
  - Get active players
  - Update individual stats
  - Cache results (6-hour TTL)
  - Error handling and logging

- [ ] `updateHitRateCalculations()`
  - Get active players
  - Calculate hit rates for each category
  - Cache results (24-hour TTL)
  - Error handling and logging

## Methods for Future Development (Skip for Now)

### Error Recovery and Notifications
- [ ] `fallbackToPreviousDay()` - Advanced error recovery
- [ ] `notifyAdmins()` - External notification system

### Data Validation
- [ ] `validateStats()` - Advanced data validation
- [ ] `validateHitRates()` - Advanced statistical validation

## Implementation Requirements

### Dependencies
- [ ] Redis template configuration
- [ ] Repository interfaces
- [ ] Monitoring service
- [ ] Cache services
- [ ] Logging configuration

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for each implemented method
- [ ] Integration tests for Redis operations
- [ ] Mock repository responses
- [ ] Error handling verification

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Progress tracking in Redis
- [ ] Error counting
- [ ] Cache hit/miss tracking
- [ ] Performance metrics

## Cache TTL Configuration
- [ ] Player stats: 6 hours
- [ ] Hit rates: 24 hours
- [ ] Warming progress: 24 hours

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All core methods implemented
- [ ] Tests passing with good coverage
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Monitoring in place
- [ ] Documentation updated
